This site is the product of a couple of interests – one long-standing (reading) and one fairly recent (web development). Goes without saying that it's a work in progress and far-off finished -- still ironing out all sorts of issues so if you spot anything then please let me know.


The site is built using static-site generator [Jekyll](#). The original template for the site was forked from [Immaculate](https://siawyoung-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/siawyoung.com/immaculate/), a clean minimal-style blog focused on typography – hence the lovely Tufte-style fonts. The sidenav and aside was my own implementation. The icons were sourced from flaticon.
