General
------------------

This site is the culmination of a couple of interests – one long-standing (reading) and one fairly recent (web development). Over the last couple of years I've become increasingly worried by my poor memory, and felt like I was at a point where I could probably read anything on my bookshelf and not remember having read it the first time around. I thought a good way to prevent against this happening in the future would be to keep notes – which, however patchily, I have sort of done – or better yet turn those notes into some long-form reviews. I've been pretty bogged down in getting the site to work, but like I say, I'm pretty new to web development so there could well be some kinks that need ironing out here and there.

The site is built using static-site generator [Jekyll](#). The original template for the site was forked from [Immaculate](#) a clean minimal-style blog focused on typography – hence the lovely [Tufte CSS](#) fonts. The sidenav and aside was my own implementation. The icons were sourced from flaticon:
