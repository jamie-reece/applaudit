She stood in the doorway swamped in her greatcoat, buttoned as ever to the top, with a scruff of emerald green scarf bulging about the collar. Her legs were lightly splayed and her large arthritic hands wavered gently at her sides. The left hanging loose, and the right, as I have always remembered it, firmly clasped around the head of her blackthorn stick, the broad knuckles showing white.
“Come, quick, a bird,” she stammered in low animated tones, straining in her usual way.
I clamped the lid on the tin of varnish and advanced then from the yard to meet her wild eyes in the hallway where she had receded slightly to leave me room to step inside.
The flesh of her cheeks was flecked with a small streak of crimson, and the grey whiskers about her mouth stood out against the green-grey hue of her skin.
“Now,” she hesitated, “a bird,” she repeated, straining still, gesturing towards the kitchen a sharp flick of her blackthorn.
“In there... in the oven,” she called after me as I stooped through the low doorway onto the clay tiled floor.
“Must’ve flown down the chimney”, she said, yelling now, unable to hear the volume of her own voice, and began to shuffle off the spot toward where I’d been ushered, scarcely able to lift those thick leather brogues off the floor. Her lashless eyes were still wide and wild as she heaved her layered body toward the aga.
“Now,” she muttered several times during her slow approach, perhaps reassuring me that she was still advancing and time for action imminent, or perhaps coaxing her limbs that they must go on.
She reached the aga at last and planted her free hand on its protruding rung, then tapped its facade with another flick of the blackthorn, a metallic din resonating through the room.
“Now,” she said once more, reiterating her arrival at the great antiquated machine.
I began to ask something, but before the words had materialised she cut me short with a grunt, heaving the air through that rattling jaw, and cocked her head to one side, slightly craning an ear toward the hot plates.

I imitated her then, listening out intently for a sound of life from within. Some moments passed. Not knowing what sound I was waiting for, others came to me: the heavy uneven breathing of my great aunt pierced intermittently by water droplets falling in the metallic basin by the window behind her; the sound of the cistern refilling itself; the blustering day rushing at the panes outside; the steady rumble of a distant engine; and a few flies languidly pursuing its expanse from the inside. 

A chirp sounded then, closer than these things but somehow distant, muffled by the thick cladded metal, and she, my great aunt, turned toward me her jaw slightly dropping, letting through a thick gasp. We waited for the sound to repeat itself, or another like it, a confirmation. She fixed her eyes intently on me, and something inexplicable about her gaze made me turn mine askance. Its intensity perhaps, I don’t know.

Sure enough the sound came again, louder now, or perhaps just expected, and she gave a start, juddering, then began to move off toward the hallway, muttering something incomprehensible as she went, lost in the folds of her scarf. Idly, I lingered where I was, knowing did not care for my agency, only for my help, stubborn and unyielding in her now unknown but certainly ancient age. As she took her time fumbling loudly in the cardboard boxes that lay strewn in the hallway, I began to wonder how she could possibly have heard this small voice from within, behind, beneath, or at least near, the aga; she who shouted because she could not hear her own voice, she who scarcely seemed to register any comprehension at all when I spoke to her. 
I thought, perhaps, it was all a ruse, and she laughed herself to sleep thinking of this deceit, carried off so deftly and convincingly. But then I thought better of it, for what could she stand to gain from devising such an act? But that was not it, no, for one must surely not thinking of purpose so close to the end of a life. No, and in any case, it was of no consequence. To me she can be no other than what she presents. There is no veil, and even if there were she would no longer know what it had intended to conceal.
My thoughts often wandered thus in this house - something about its awkward familiarity, something about these enormous lapses that divided the time. She had at last found what she had been looking for, and shuffled back in, brandishing a torch that looked strangely diminished in her huge angular hand.
“Now,” she said once more, holding it out to me, her hand shaking, and gestured that it must be wound. She started expectantly, unusually close, as I laboriously wound the revolving arm. It felt, oddly, that this motion did something other than just wind the torch; it seemed somehow that a tension grew in the room with this ridiculous rhythmic clunk, her eyes seeming to widen with each revolution.
“Enough,” she let slip abruptly, and snatched at the torch, I detected unnervingly some of the strength that still lingered in those coarse, ribbed hands.

We turned, both of us at once, toward the aga. She leaned her faithful blackthorn against the great machine,and used instead the aga’s rung to steady her weight. After laying the torch on its surface, she arched over, the heels of brogues lifting slightly off the clay, and began to rattle a small vent behind the hot plates. She prised at its clasp obstinately for some moments, then, giving up, turned briefly to me, suggesting reluctantly without words that I intervene. I found a screwdriver amongst the hoard in the hallway and prised it off; to which she gave no reaction at all.
“There,” she heaved, nodding eagerly toward the aga’s black innards.
